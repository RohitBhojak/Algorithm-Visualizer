# [Algorithm Visualizer](https://rohitbhojak.github.io/Algorithm-Visualizer/)

## Overview

The **Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive tool to understand sorting and searching algorithms through step-by-step visualizations. It includes:
- A homepage linking to sorting and searching visualizations.
- Dynamic visualizations that adapt to user inputs and screen sizes.

## Features

### Sorting Visualization
- Algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, and Heap Sort.
- Features: Adjustable array size, animation speed, and step-by-step highlights.

### Searching Visualization
- Algorithms: Linear and Binary Search.
- Features: Dynamic array generation, adjustable speed, and step-by-step search highlights.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/algorithm-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage
1. Navigate to Sorting or Searching from the homepage.
2. Select an algorithm, configure options, and start the visualization.

## Future Improvements
- Add more algorithms.
- Add light/dark mode themes.
